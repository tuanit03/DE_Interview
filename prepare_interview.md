### Introduction Yourself

My name is Ngo Anh Tuan.
I am a final-year student majoring in Computer Science at Hanoi University of Industry.

I am passionate about algorithms and exploring new technologies.
I have experience with Python, SQL, and big data tools like Apache Airflow and Spark. I also have skills in using AWS Cloud services.

One of my strengths is independent thinking. I enjoy analyzing problems systematically and finding effective solutions.
About my weakness, my English is quite bad. I only understand English related to my field. However, I am constantly working to improve it.

I want to learn more about my field and improve my skills. 

I think this internship is a good opportunity to grow.

I understand the problem first, then break it into smaller parts. 

I research and test solutions until it works.

I search online or ask my team. I am always ready to learn.

### Basic Concepts

**Q: What is the role of a Data Engineer?**  
A: A Data Engineer builds systems to collect, store, and process data. They ensure data is clean, organized, and accessible.  

**Q: What is ETL?**  
A: ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is the process of extracting data from sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into storage systems.

**Q: What is a data pipeline?**  
A: A data pipeline is a series of steps to move data from a source to a destination, like databases or analytics tools.

### Databases

**Q: What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?**  
A: SQL is for structured data with predefined schemas. NoSQL is for unstructured or flexible data, like JSON or key-value pairs.  

**Q: Can you name some common databases?**  
A: SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL. NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra.

**Q: How do you optimize a SQL query?**  
A: Use indexing, avoid SELECT *, and filter data with WHERE conditions.

---

### Big Data

**Q: What is Big Data?**  
A: Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that are difficult to process with traditional tools.

**Q: What tools are used for Big Data processing?**  
A: Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Kafka.

**Q: What is HDFS?**  
A: HDFS is Hadoop Distributed File System, used to store large datasets across many machines.

---

### Programming

**Q: What programming languages are common for Data Engineering?**  
A: Python, SQL, and Java are common.

**Q: Can you explain Pythonâ€™s `pandas` library?**  
A: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, like cleaning and organizing data.

**Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?**  
A: A list is mutable; a tuple is immutable.

---

### Data Formats

**Q: What is the difference between CSV and JSON?**  
A: CSV is a simple text format with rows and columns. JSON is a key-value format for structured data.

**Q: What is Parquet?**  
A: Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for large-scale data processing.

---

### Tools and Frameworks

**Q: What is Apache Spark?**  
A: Spark is a tool for fast data processing and analytics.  

**Q: What is Docker?**  
A: Docker is a platform to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments.

---


### Data Warehousing

**Q: What is a Data Warehouse?**  
A: A Data Warehouse is a system used to store large amounts of structured data for reporting and analysis.

**Q: Can you name some Data Warehousing tools?**  
A: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake.

**Q: What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?**  
A: OLTP handles transaction data (e.g., banking). OLAP handles analytical data (e.g., sales reports).

---

### Data Modeling

**Q: What is Data Modeling?**  
A: Data Modeling is designing the structure of a database, like tables and relationships.

**Q: What are the types of Data Models?**  
A: Conceptual, Logical, and Physical.

**Q: What is a primary key?**  
A: A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table.

**Q: What is a foreign key?**  
A: A foreign key links one table to another.

---

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

**Q: How do you handle duplicate data?**  
A: I use SQL's DISTINCT keyword or Python's `drop_duplicates()` in pandas.

**Q: What is data normalization?**  
A: It organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

**Q: How do you deal with outliers?**  
A: I remove them or cap them using statistical methods like Z-scores.

---

### Data Integration

**Q: What is Data Integration?**  
A: Combining data from different sources into a single view.

**Q: What tools are used for Data Integration?**  
A: Talend, Apache Nifi, Informatica.

**Q: How do you ensure data consistency during integration?**  
A: Use schema mapping, data validation, and monitoring.

---

### Distributed Systems

**Q: What is a distributed system?**  
A: A system where data and processing are spread across multiple machines.

**Q: Why use distributed systems?**  
A: They improve scalability, performance, and fault tolerance.

**Q: What is MapReduce?**  
A: A programming model for processing large datasets across multiple machines.

---

### File Systems

**Q: What is the difference between a local file system and a distributed file system?**  
A: A local file system works on one machine; a distributed file system works across many machines.

**Q: Can you explain the term "data partitioning"?**  
A: Data partitioning splits data into smaller chunks for faster processing.

---

### APIs

**Q: What is an API?**  
A: API stands for Application Programming Interface, allowing software to communicate.

**Q: What is a REST API?**  
A: REST API is a web service using HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE.

A: APIs allow data extraction and integration from external systems.

---
### Real-Time Processing

**Q: What is the difference between batch processing and real-time processing?**

### Optional
An API is a way for different software systems to communicate. Yes, I have used REST APIs to fetch data and display it in a web application.

HTTP is a protocol for transferring data, but it is not secure. HTTPS is secure because it uses encryption with SSL/TLS.

Frontend development focuses on the user interface and experience, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend development is about the server, database, and logic using tools like Python or Node.js.

Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy. For example, splitting a table into multiple related tables.

Docker is a tool to create and manage containers. It helps in running applications consistently across environments.

I know basic Linux commands for file management, process control, and setting up a server.

I read tech blogs, watch YouTube tutorials, and take online courses to learn about new tools and frameworks.

There are **four main types** of NoSQL databases:  

1. **Key-Value Stores**  
   - Data: Key-value pairs.  
   - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.  

2. **Document Stores**  
   - Data: JSON, BSON, or XML documents.  
   - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.  

3. **Column-Family Stores**  
   - Data: Columns grouped into families.  
   - Examples: Cassandra, HBase.  

4. **Graph Databases**  
   - Data: Nodes and edges (relationships).  
   - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
